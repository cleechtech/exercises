//~ This problem is the same as the previous but introduces the concept of
//~ modules. You will need to create two files to solve this.
//~ 
//~ Create a program that prints a list of files in a given directory,
//~ filtered by the extension of the files. The first argument is the
//~ directory name and the second argument is the extension filter. Print
//~ the list of files to the console. You must use asynchronous I/O.
//~ 
//~ Your program must use a module to do most of the work. The module
//~ must export a single function that takes three arguments: the
//~ directory name, the filter string and a callback function.
//~ 
//~ The callback must return an error, and only an error, as the first
//~ argument if one is passed from your call to `fs.readdir()`. If there
//~ are no errors then the first argument to the callback must be null and
//~ the second must be your filtered list of files in an array.
//~ 
//~ In the case of an error bubbling up to your original program file,
//~ simply check for it and print an informative message to the console.
