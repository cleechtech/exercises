1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
We now have a respectable understanding of the periodic

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
table itself and the atoms in them.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
And now we're ready to deal with molecules themselves.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
And to deal with molecules, we have to have some way of

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:12,000
representing them.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
And you represent them with formulas.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
And there's two major-- actually, three major ways to

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
represent a molecule.

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:28,000
One is the molecular formula.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
And the other is the empirical formula.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:39,000
And I'll do it in a different color to differentiate it.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
And the difference is, well, let's just talk about what the

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
word empirical means.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I remember when I first took chemistry the teacher kept

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
using the word empirical.

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Well, what does empirical really mean?

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I clearly did not have a very deep vocabulary.

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I forgot what age I was.

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
But it means achieved through observation or experiment, or

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
based on experience.

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
So if someone said that they empirically figured out x, y,

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
or z, it means that they figured it out through an

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
experiment or they observed it.

24
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
The molecular formula is essentially the actual number

25
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
of atoms in that molecule.

26
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Let me show you what I'm talking about.

27
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
So the empirical formula tells you what people have observed.

28
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Maybe before they even knew that there was such a thing as

29
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
atoms, what they would have observed is the ratio of the

30
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
atoms to one another in a molecule without knowing in

31
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
the exact molecule how many of that atom there are.

32
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Let me show you what I'm talking about.

33
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:42,000
So if I were to give you, I don't know, a benzene, the

34
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
molecular formula of benzene, you have 6 carbon atoms and

35
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:53,000
you have 6 hydrogen atoms. Now, if you were some chemist

36
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
in the 1800's and you didn't know about the actual atoms,

37
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
but if you had a big bag of benzene and you were to

38
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
measure the ratio of the carbon to the hydrogen that

39
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
you had in that bag, you would find out that for every one

40
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
carbon you have one hydrogen.

41
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
So your empirical formula is the ratio of the two.

42
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
You don't know that each atom actually has 6 of these, but

43
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
you know that for every carbon, there's a hydrogen.

44
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
And for every hydrogen there's a carbon.

45
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
And the way to go back, you can go from the molecular

46
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
formula to the empirical formula very easily.

47
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
You just find the greatest common divisor of the number

48
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
of atoms in the molecule.

49
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
So the greatest common divisor is six, and six is obviously

50
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
six, you divide both of these by six and you get the

51
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
empirical formula.

52
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
It's not easy.

53
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
You pretty much can't go back from the empirical formula to

54
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,000
the molecular formula.

55
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
You've lost information.

56
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I don't know whether this was C6H6.

57
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Was it C2H2?

58
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
You just don't know.

59
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
And I mentioned right at the beginning of the video that

60
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
there's a third way to represent molecules.

61
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
And that's the structural formula.

62
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
And we'll do that, off and on, and we've already done it a

63
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
little bit.

64
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Let me show you.

65
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
The structural formula for benzene would actually say how

66
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
the molecular formula atoms are configured.

67
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
So benzene in particular is very interesting.

68
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
It looks like this.

69
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
It's often drawn like this.

70
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
And you'll see this a lot when you take organic chemistry.

71
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
But it looks like a little hexagon, where the vertices of

72
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
the hexagon are carbon atoms. So let me draw the carbon

73
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
atoms in yellow.

74
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
So this is carbon, carbon, carbon,

75
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
carbon, carbon, carbon.

76
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
They have double bonds, every other carbon.

77
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Double bonds.

78
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
And then they have single bonds to hydrogen.

79
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Let me just do the hydrogen in another color.

80
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Let me do it in magenta.

81
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Hydrogen.

82
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
And obviously, the structural formula gives you the most

83
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
information.

84
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Right?

85
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Then you can start to think about, gee, how will this

86
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
interact with other things?

87
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
While the molecular formula just tells you what's in the

88
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
molecule, the empirical formula really gives you the

89
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
least information.

90
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
It just tells you the ratio of the different

91
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
items in the molecule.

92
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Structural formula.

93
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Let's do a couple more.

94
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
OK, what if we're dealing with, let's say we're dealing

95
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
with water.

96
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I think you know the molecular formula for water.

97
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
H2O.

98
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Now what would be the empirical formula for this?

99
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Well we want to know the ratio, so for every oxygen

100
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
there's two hydrogens.

101
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Or I guess you could say for every hydrogen

102
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
there's a half of oxygen.

103
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
So you can't reduce this.

104
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,000
If I wrote this as H2O1, what's the greatest common

105
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
divisor of 2 and 1?

106
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Well, it's 1, so you just have to divide them by 1.

107
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,000
So in this case, the empirical and the molecular formula are

108
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
the exact same thing.

109
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
It's H2O.

110
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
What about sulfur?

111
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
And an interesting molecule, because obviously,

112
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
it's just one atom.

113
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Sulfur.

114
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Sorry, no, I'm spelling it wrong.

115
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
No.

116
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
No, it's not a p h, it's f.

117
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Clearly, I shouldn't be making spelling videos.

118
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:23,000
So sulfur.

119
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
So the molecular formula S8.

120
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
So it forms this neat kind of

121
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
octagon-looking chain of sulfurs.

122
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
And if I were to draw that, you would see that.

123
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
And you could look it up on Wikipedia, if you like.

124
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
But its empirical formula, if you had just a bag of sulfur,

125
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
you don't know that each atom has eight sulfurs.

126
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
You just have a big bag of sulfur.

127
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
So, in the empirical formula, there's only one

128
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
atom in this molecule.

129
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
You divide by eight and you get S.

130
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
So you just know that all you've got there is sulfur.

131
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
So let's just do one more.

132
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Glucose.

133
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I'll pick a new color.

134
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Glucose.

135
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:11,000
The molecular formula is C6H12O6.

136
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
So for every carbon, there are how many?

137
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
For every 6 carbons, there's 12 hydrogen and 1 oxygen.

138
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
So if you kind of reduce this formula to its empirical form,

139
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
what do you get?

140
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Let's see, you can divide all these numbers by 6, so we get

141
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,000
1 carbon, 2 hydrogens, and 1 oxygen.

142
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
So this just tells you the ratio that they exist in a big

143
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
bag of this molecule.

144
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
This tells you the exact number of

145
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
atoms in that molecule.

146
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Fair enough.

147
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
So now we know a little bit of the difference between

148
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
molecular formula, and empirical formula, and

149
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,000
structural formula.

150
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Now let's see if we can use what we know about the

151
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
formulas and the periodic table to think a little bit

152
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:59,000
about the composition, the mass composition, of some of

153
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
these molecules.

154
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
So the first thing to even think about is, how do you

155
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
figure out the molecular mass?

156
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Right?

157
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I have my little periodic table down there.

158
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:18,000
So molecular mass.

159
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
So the first question is, how do you figure out-- I mean,

160
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
the molecular mass is going to be the sum of all of the atoms

161
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
in that molecule, right?

162
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
So if you wanted to know the molecular mass of-- let's say

163
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
you wanted to know how much does one

164
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
molecule of benzene mass?

165
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I don't want to say weight, because it should be

166
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
independent of what planet you're on.

167
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,000
So what is the mass of one molecule of benzene?

168
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Well, all you do is you add up the masses of the different

169
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
constituents.

170
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
So you have 6 carbons and 6 hydrogens.

171
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,000
So let's do benzene.

172
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
You have 6 carbons and 6 hydrogens.

173
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
So what's the mass of each carbon?

174
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
So let's go back down to the periodic table.

175
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Just to give proper credit, I got this off of the Los Alamos

176
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
National Laboratories website.

177
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
So let's see, the atomic mass of carbon.

178
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
The reason why I used this one instead of my previous one is

179
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
my previous periodic table that I got off Wikipedia only

180
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
had atomic numbers on them.

181
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
But now that we're actually going to start talking about

182
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
the mass composition of different atoms

183
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,000
or different molecules.

184
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
We're going to have to start looking at the

185
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
atomic mass, right?

186
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Remember, the atomic mass, when you think about atomic

187
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
mass units, it's just the number of protons plus the

188
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
number of neutrons.

189
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
So you have six protons in carbon

190
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
and roughly six neutrons.

191
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
And why is there this decimal?

192
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Because, as we said before, this is an average of all of

193
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
the masses of the isotopes you'll find of carbon.

194
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
So there's a little bit of carbon 14 on the planet, very

195
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
little, but most of the carbon is carbon 12.

196
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
When you proportionately average them, you get 12.01.

197
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
But let's say we're dealing with carbon 12, just because

198
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:09,000
that's the most common element.

199
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Carbon is 12 atomic mass units.

200
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Right?

201
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
And atomic mass units is a unit of mass.

202
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
And we'll talk about how small it is.

203
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
It's a very, very, very, very small fraction

204
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
of a gram or kilogram.

205
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
And we'll talk about that, probably in the next video.

206
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
So carbon is 12 atomic mass units.

207
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
What about hydrogen?

208
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Let's see.

209
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
We go to our periodic table.

210
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Hydrogen is here in this dark blue.

211
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
And I don't know if you can read it, but this is

212
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
interesting, the atomic number of hydrogen is 1.

213
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:45,000
The atomic mass of hydrogen is 1.0008.

214
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
So that tells us that most of the hydrogen on this planet

215
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
has an atomic mass of 1.

216
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Which tells us that it essentially has no neutrons.

217
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
That hydrogen is a kind of an interesting nucleus there,

218
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
where there is really just a proton.

219
00:09:58,000 --> 00:010:00,000
Just a proton sitting in that nucleus.

220
00:010:00,000 --> 00:010:03,000
And so if you were to ionize hydrogen.

221
00:010:03,000 --> 00:010:05,000
If you were to turn into a cation and take one of its

222
00:010:05,000 --> 00:010:08,000
electrons away, what are you left with?

223
00:010:08,000 --> 00:010:09,000
You just have a proton.

224
00:010:09,000 --> 00:010:13,000
A proton sitting by itself, just a single proton, really

225
00:010:13,000 --> 00:010:17,000
is no different than a hydrogen ion.

226
00:010:17,000 --> 00:010:19,000
And that to me is kind of interesting.

227
00:010:19,000 --> 00:010:20,000
That hydrogen is that simple.

228
00:010:20,000 --> 00:010:23,000
It's really just a proton.

229
00:010:23,000 --> 00:010:25,000
So hydrogen has an atomic mass of 1.

230
00:010:25,000 --> 00:010:27,000
Right?

231
00:010:27,000 --> 00:010:31,000
If it had any neutrons in it, it would have been at least an

232
00:010:31,000 --> 00:010:32,000
atomic mass of 2.

233
00:010:32,000 --> 00:010:35,000
But hydrogen has atomic mass of 1.

234
00:010:35,000 --> 00:010:37,000
One atomic mass unit.

235
00:010:37,000 --> 00:010:43,000
So what is the mass of one molecule of benzene?

236
00:010:43,000 --> 00:010:45,000
Well it's 6 times the carbon mass.

237
00:010:45,000 --> 00:010:51,000
6 times 12 plus 6 times the mass of hydrogen.

238
00:010:51,000 --> 00:010:52,000
Plus 6 times 1.

239
00:010:52,000 --> 00:010:59,000
So that is 6 times 12, is 72, plus 6 times 1, plus 6, is

240
00:010:59,000 --> 00:011:01,000
equal to 78.

241
00:011:01,000 --> 00:011:04,000
Now, what if someone said, what percent

242
00:011:04,000 --> 00:011:08,000
of benzene is carbon?

243
00:011:08,000 --> 00:011:10,000
Well then you say, OK, this is the piece that's

244
00:011:10,000 --> 00:011:12,000
carbon, right here.

245
00:011:12,000 --> 00:011:17,000
The carbon piece of benzene is 72 atomic mass units.

246
00:011:17,000 --> 00:011:18,000
Right, that's carbon.

247
00:011:18,000 --> 00:011:21,000
So what percentage of benzene is carbon?

248
00:011:21,000 --> 00:011:23,000
Well it's 72 over 78.

249
00:011:23,000 --> 00:011:24,000
The whole thing is 78.

250
00:011:24,000 --> 00:011:28,000
So it's 72 over 78.

251
00:011:28,000 --> 00:011:29,000
And what does that equal?

252
00:011:29,000 --> 00:011:36,000
Let me get a calculator going.

253
00:011:36,000 --> 00:011:42,000
I should've had my calculator open ahead of time.

254
00:011:42,000 --> 00:011:43,000
All right.

255
00:011:43,000 --> 00:011:51,000
So 72 divided by 78 is equal to 92.3%.

256
00:011:51,000 --> 00:012:00,000
So benzene is 92.3% carbon by mass.

257
00:012:00,000 --> 00:012:03,000
And of course, the remainder, the 7.7%,

258
00:012:03,000 --> 00:012:05,000
is going to be hydrogen.

259
00:012:05,000 --> 00:012:08,000
Let's do that for a couple of these other guys down here.

260
00:012:08,000 --> 00:012:11,000
So let's say we wanted to know what is the mass of

261
00:012:11,000 --> 00:012:13,000
a molecule of water?

262
00:012:13,000 --> 00:012:14,000
Fair enough.

263
00:012:14,000 --> 00:012:16,000
There's enough water on the planet, if you want to know

264
00:012:16,000 --> 00:012:16,000
what that is.

265
00:012:16,000 --> 00:012:19,000
Well we already know what the mass of a hydrogen is.

266
00:012:19,000 --> 00:012:20,000
It's 1.

267
00:012:20,000 --> 00:012:21,000
Right?

268
00:012:21,000 --> 00:012:23,000
Hydrogen is 1.

269
00:012:23,000 --> 00:012:25,000
One atomic mass unit.

270
00:012:25,000 --> 00:012:27,000
Oxygen is what?

271
00:012:27,000 --> 00:012:30,000
Oxygen is 16.

272
00:012:30,000 --> 00:012:32,000
Notice, it's exactly 16.

273
00:012:32,000 --> 00:012:37,000
So on most of the planet, you pretty much have, in an oxygen

274
00:012:37,000 --> 00:012:41,000
atom, you have 8 protons and exactly 8 neutrons.

275
00:012:41,000 --> 00:012:45,000
So you get an atomic mass of 16.

276
00:012:45,000 --> 00:012:49,000
So oxygen has an atomic mass of 16 atomic mass units.

277
00:012:49,000 --> 00:012:52,000
So the atomic mass of the entire molecule, you have 2

278
00:012:52,000 --> 00:012:57,000
hydrogens, so you have 2 times the mass of hydrogen plus 1

279
00:012:57,000 --> 00:013:03,000
oxygen-- plus 16-- so that equals 18 atomic

280
00:013:03,000 --> 00:013:06,000
mass units for water.

281
00:013:06,000 --> 00:013:09,000
And once again, if you want to say, what percent by mass of

282
00:013:09,000 --> 00:013:12,000
water is oxygen?

283
00:013:12,000 --> 00:013:14,000
Well it's 16 out of the 18, right?

284
00:013:14,000 --> 00:013:15,000
Is oxygen.

285
00:013:15,000 --> 00:013:19,000
So if we get the calculator back, you get 16

286
00:013:19,000 --> 00:013:22,000
divided by 18 is water.

287
00:013:22,000 --> 00:013:26,000
So, let's say you round it, 88.9% water.

288
00:013:26,000 --> 00:013:34,000
Sorry, 88.9% oxygen.

289
00:013:34,000 --> 00:013:36,000
So most of water is oxygen.

290
00:013:36,000 --> 00:013:39,000
And this is interesting, even though you have two hydrogens

291
00:013:39,000 --> 00:013:45,000
here, two hydrogens for every one oxygen, oxygen's mass is

292
00:013:45,000 --> 00:013:48,000
so much larger-- it's 16 times larger-- that

293
00:013:48,000 --> 00:013:54,000
most of water is oxygen.

294
00:013:54,000 --> 00:013:56,000
Well, I'm probably running out of time, so the next video I'm

295
00:013:56,000 --> 00:013:57,000
going to talk about how do we go backwards.

296
00:013:57,000 --> 00:014:00,000
If someone gives you the composition, how can you get

297
00:014:00,000 --> 00:014:01,000
the empirical formula.

298
00:014:01,000 --> 00:014:03,000
Actually on a side note, slightly unrelated to what I

299
00:014:03,000 --> 00:014:09,000
just talked about, I was doing some research last night about

300
00:014:09,000 --> 00:014:11,000
metals, because they're actually interesting, about

301
00:014:11,000 --> 00:014:16,000
why some metals conduct more and some conduct less.

302
00:014:16,000 --> 00:014:18,000
Because when I first talked about, you know, these were

303
00:014:18,000 --> 00:014:19,000
obviously the transition metals.

304
00:014:19,000 --> 00:014:22,000
They're backfilling their d orbitals.

305
00:014:22,000 --> 00:014:28,000
And I said, hey, the periodic table that was in-- I think I

306
00:014:28,000 --> 00:014:30,000
was looking in a Princeton Review book that described

307
00:014:30,000 --> 00:014:33,000
these as metals and described these as transition metals.

308
00:014:33,000 --> 00:014:36,000
And I was like, hey, you know, that's kind of not fair,

309
00:014:36,000 --> 00:014:41,000
because I consider iron and copper and gold and silver to

310
00:014:41,000 --> 00:014:43,000
be as metallic as anything.

311
00:014:43,000 --> 00:014:46,000
Why should these be called transition metals and these be

312
00:014:46,000 --> 00:014:47,000
just called regular metals.

313
00:014:47,000 --> 00:014:50,000
And it actually turns out that a common name for these are

314
00:014:50,000 --> 00:014:52,000
poor metals.

315
00:014:52,000 --> 00:014:54,000
Poor metals.

316
00:014:54,000 --> 00:014:57,000
Because, to a large degree, they're softer, they have

317
00:014:57,000 --> 00:015:00,000
lower melting points, so the intuition was right.

318
00:015:00,000 --> 00:015:05,000
To a large degree, when we think of metals, these are the

319
00:015:05,000 --> 00:015:06,000
metals I think of.

320
00:015:06,000 --> 00:015:10,000
And when we think of metallic nature in a chemistry sense--

321
00:015:10,000 --> 00:015:13,000
we talked a lot about that, who wants to donate their

322
00:015:13,000 --> 00:015:15,000
electrons the most, that's metallic nature.

323
00:015:15,000 --> 00:015:17,000
They're the guys down here.

324
00:015:17,000 --> 00:015:19,000
And as you go to the top right, these want to donate

325
00:015:19,000 --> 00:015:21,000
their electrons the least. These are the most

326
00:015:21,000 --> 00:015:22,000
electronegative.

327
00:015:22,000 --> 00:015:24,000
They like electrons the most, so they actually have some of

328
00:015:24,000 --> 00:015:27,000
the worst metallic nature, so it actually makes sense to

329
00:015:27,000 --> 00:015:30,000
call them poor metals.

330
00:015:30,000 --> 00:015:32,000
And there's some debate on whether these should even be

331
00:015:32,000 --> 00:015:33,000
called poor metals.

332
00:015:33,000 --> 00:015:36,000
If you look up a bunch of periodic tables, some will

333
00:015:36,000 --> 00:015:37,000
call these metals.

334
00:015:37,000 --> 00:015:38,000
Some will call these poor metals.

335
00:015:38,000 --> 00:015:40,000
But I just wanted to throw that out there just so you're

336
00:015:40,000 --> 00:015:41,000
exposed to it.

337
00:015:41,000 --> 00:015:44,000
And so, you know, for me, it is a little bit more intuitive

338
00:015:44,000 --> 00:015:46,000
to call these poor metals, because they have less

339
00:015:46,000 --> 00:015:49,000
metallic nature than the stuff, especially down here,

340
00:015:49,000 --> 00:015:51,000
the alkali and the alkaline earth metals.

341
00:015:51,000 --> 00:0,000
Anyway, see you in the next video.
